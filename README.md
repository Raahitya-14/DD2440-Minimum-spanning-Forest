# DD2440 Minimum spanning Forest

 This Repository contains the final project in DD2440 Advanced Algorithms at KTH. For this project, our goal was to develop a sub-linear time algorithm for 
 estimating the weight of a minimum-spanning forest (MSF) with a maximum a
 relative error of 0.1 in either direction.
